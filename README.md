# Tile Resource Mapper Tool

The Tile Resource Mapper Tool is a Rust library that creates a Hashmap with all the Contents discovered by the robot, including  their quantity and coordinates. It is designed to work with the [robotics_lib](https://advancedprogramming.disi.unitn.it/crate?name=robotics_lib) library.

## Features

- Find the Tile, between the ones that have been discovered, that has the higher number of a specific Content. 
- Find the closest Tile that has at least one of the Content that we want.
- Handle errors, including cases where the robot has not discovered the specific Content we are looking for or any Tile of the world.

## Usage

```rust
use tile_resource_mapper_tool::tool::tile_resource_mapper_tool{...};




```

## Examples

```rust

```
